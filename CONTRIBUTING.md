## Environment Setup

The purpose of this guide is to enable developers of Tabpy to install the project
and run it locally.

## Prerequisites

These are prerequisites for an environment required for a contributor to
be able to work on TabPy changes:

- Python 3.6.5:
  - To see which version of Python you have installed, run ```python --version```.
- git
- TabPy repo:
  - Get the latest TabPy repository with `git clone https://github.com/tableau/TabPy.git`
  - Create a new branch for your changes.
  - When changes are ready push them on github and create merge request.

## Cloning TabPy Repository

1. Open your OS shell.
2. Navigate to the folder in which you would like to save
   your local TabPy repository.
3. In the command prompt, enter the following commands:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tableau/TabPy.git
    cd TabPy
    ```

Before making any code changes run environment setup script.
For Windows run this command from the repository root folder:

```sh
utils\set_env.cmd
```

and for Linux or Mac the next command from the repository root folder:

```sh
source utils/set_env.sh
```

## Unit Tests

TabPy has test suites for `tabpy-server` and `tabpy-tools` components.
To run the unit tests use `pytest` which you may need to install first
(see [https://docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org) for details):

```sh
pytest tests/unit
```

Check `pytest` documentation for how to run individual tests or set of tests.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests can be executed with the next command:

```sh
pytest tests/integration
```

## Code Coverage

You can run unit tests to collect code coverage data. To do so run `pytest`
either for server or tools test, or even combined:

```sh
pytest tests --cov=tabpy-server/tabpy_server --cov=tabpy-tools/tabpy_tools --cov-append
```

## TabPy in Python Virtual Environment

It is possible (and recommended) to run TabPy in a virtual environment. More
details are on
[TabPy in Python virtual environment](docs/tabpy-virtualenv.md) page.

## Documentation Updates

For any process, scripts or API changes documentation needs to be updated accordingly.
Please use markdown validation tools like web-based [markdownlint](https://dlaa.me/markdownlint/)
or npm [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli).

TOC for markdown file is built with [markdown-toc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-toc):

```sh
markdown-toc -i docs/server-startup.md
```

These checks will run as part of the build if you submit a pull request.

## TabPy with Swagger

You can invoke the TabPy Server API against a running TabPy instance with Swagger.

- Make CORS related changes in TabPy configuration file: update `tabpy-server\state.ini`
  file in your local repository to have the next settings:

```config
[Service Info]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers = Origin, X-Requested-with, Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Methods = GET, OPTIONS, POST
```

- Start a local instance of TabPy server following [TabPy Server Startup Guide](docs/server-startup.md).
- Run a local copy of Swagger editor with steps provided at
  [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor).
- Open `misc/TabPy.yml` in Swagger editor.
- In case your TabPy server does not run on `localhost:9004` update
  `host` value in `TabPy.yml` accordingly.

## Code styling

`pycodestyle` is used to check Python code against our style conventions.
You can run install it and run locally for files where modifications were made:

```sh
pip install pycodestyle
```

And then run it for files where modifications were made, e.g.:

```sh
pycodestyle tabpy-server/server_tests/test_pwd_file.py
```

For reported errors and warnings either fix them manually or auto-format files with
`autopep8`.

To install `autopep8` run the next command:

```sh
pip install autopep8
```

Then you can run the tool for a file. In the example below `-i`
option tells `autopep8` to update the file. Without the option it
outputs formatted code to the console.

```sh
autopep8 -i tabpy-server/server_tests/test_pwd_file.py
```

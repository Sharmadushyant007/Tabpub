# TabPy Server Download

The TabPy server can be downloaded from
[TabPy github releases page](https://github.com/tableau/TabPy/releases).
Read the description for the releases and then download the appropriate
`zip` or `tar.gz` TabPy archive to your machine. The latest release
of TabPy is strongly recommended unless you have a specific restriction
or package incompatability you need to consider.

After downloading the archive unpack it to a folder on your machine and
you are ready to start running TabPy from that folder. Read the
[configuration](server-config.md) and [starting up instructions](server-startup.md)
for more details.
